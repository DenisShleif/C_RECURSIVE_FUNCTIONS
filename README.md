# C_RECURSIVE_FUNCTIONS

This repository contains 15 small programs that demonstrate my knowledge of recursive functions. Each program performs a specific task listed below. Each program performs the task both recursively and iteratively.


List of Functions:

 - Q1: 	Write a function to compute the nth term in the following sequence of numbers: 17, 26, 35, 44, 53, … Return the term.
 - Q2: 	A sequence is defined by the following recurrence relation: t(n) = 7t(n-1) - 4t(n-2) - 9t(n-3) and the base case: t(1) = 0, t(2) = 5 and t(3) = 3. Write a function to determine t(n) given n.
 - Q3: 	A sequence is defined by the following recurrence relation: t(n) = at(n-1) - bt(n-2) + ct(n-3) - dt(n-4) + e and the base case: t(1) = w, t(2) = x, t(3) = y and t(4) = z. Write a function to determine the nth term in such a sequence.
 - Q4:	Write a function to compute sum(i = m to n)(8xi) where n >= m, x ,m ,n are all integers. Return the sum
 - Q5:	Write a function to count the number of multiples of m between a and b in an array of integers A. Where b >=a, and a, b, and m are all whole numbers. NOTE that the multiples are between the whole numbers a and b … a and b are not indices in the array.
 - Q6: 	An array contains positive integers but the last element is negative. The last element of the array is called a sentinel and is used to indicate the end of the array … kind of like the NULL terminator in a string. Write a function to compute the sum of the multiples of m in the array.
 - Q7: 	Write a function that takes a string and evaluates it according to the rule that all letter chars get 10 points, all number chars get 5 points, all spaces get 20 points and all other characters get 1 point except for the addition sign which gets 0 points. Return the value of the string.
 - Q8:	Write a function to determine if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is still the same word when spelled backwards. Here are some palindromes: abba, dud, C, 845q2t2q548. The empty string is also a palindrome. Return 1 if the string is a palindrome and 0 if it is not.
 - Q9: 	Write a function that counts all of the characters, c, in the string s. Return the count of the character c in the string s.
 - Q10:	Write a function to delete the first occurrence of the character c in the string s.
 - Q11:	Write a function to delete all instances of the character c that occur in the string s.
 - Q12:	Write a function that inserts a number, n, into the correct position in an array of sorted integers A. Assume that the array is sorted in increasing order.
 - Q13:	Write a function that determines the square root of a real number r. Assume that r will be greater than or equal to 1.
 - Q14:	Write a function that finds an element key in an array of sorted integers A. If key is found then return the index of key in the array otherwise return -1 to indicate that it was not found. Assume that there are no duplicate elements in the array. Use a linear search.
 - Q15:	Repeat the previous question using a binary search.
